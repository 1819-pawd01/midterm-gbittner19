        <!--Traveling Start-->
        <h3> Traveling</h3>
        <p> I enjoy traveling and going to the beach especially over the summer. I went to <b>Key West</b> and while I was there I visited three different beaches as well as walked around some historic areas. We went on several beautiful sunset cruises. The link to visit the website is below. Also over the summer I went to <u>Chicago</u> to visit my family and look at some colleges. </p>

        <!--Sports Start-->
        <h3>Gymnastics</h3>
        <p> I did competitive gymnastics for seven years. My favorite quote that was told to my team in the gym was </p>
        <blockquote> If you don't face your fears <br />
            they will become <br />
            your limits. - Robin Sharma</blockquote>
        <p> I stopped competing last year because of school but I now work as a gymnastics coach. I coach recreational classes for kids from age four to fourteen as well as preteam and the competitive team. </p>
        <!--Sports End-->

        <!--Future Talk Start-->
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p> My favorite book that I read over the summer is, <i> Cross My Heart</i> by James Patterson. I am a senior at Padua this year and I am looking forward to college. I have not applied to any colleges yet but I am working on it. I plan on applying to University of Delaware, James Madison, Hofstra, and College of Charleston. I am looking into becoming a physical therapist. </p>
